The git commit command is used to save changes to the local repo.
 The process occurs in two steps. Using git add, the files move from 
 working directory to a staging area. Then using git commit, the files move
  from staging area to the local repo. (When we say move, the files doesn’t 
  physically move to respective stages. It is just that there state changes 
  with various commands.)

Going back to the earlier git status output.

Changes not staged for commit: The output tells us that that there is a
 file which has changed but the changes have not moved to staging yet. 
 (Then it provides a tip which says that using git add we can move a file 
 to staging area)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a"): The 
changes have not been added to the local repo. This is obvious since we 
haven’t moved changes to staging yet.
